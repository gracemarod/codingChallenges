What you'll find here.

In this repositorie I'm going to upload some of the coding challenges I have encounter in technical interviews.
The description for each exercise is in the script itself.

I will also be doing exercises from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions" 6th Edition 
by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
